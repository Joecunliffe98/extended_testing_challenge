# Extended_testing_challenge

In this repo are the file for the test cases, test plan, bug reports and the 
only piece of automation I managed to get working.

The reason this submission is solo is becuase I had major internet issues yesterday 
which made it almost impossible to work with my pair so I had to do most things offline. 
I also had some teething issues with my virtual environments as well as understanding 
the application/task which took me most of the afternoon yesterday.

I had to cut myself off on time as otherwise I could spend all week trying to go through
the automation and get more done but I am fairly happy with my manual testing but definitely
think I have places for improvement for this challenge specifically.
