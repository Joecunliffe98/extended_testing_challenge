# extended_testing_challenge

In this repo are the file for the test cases, test plan, bug reports and the only piece of automation I managed to get working.

The reason this submission is solo is becuase I had major internet issues yesterday which made it almost impossible to work with my pair so I had to do most things offline. 
I also had some teething issues with my virtual environments as well as understanding the application/task which took me most of the afternoon yesterday.
